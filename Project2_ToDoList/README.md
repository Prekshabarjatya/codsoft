# To-Do List Application

A simple command-line based To-Do List application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed or uncompleted. The tasks are saved to and loaded from a `tasks.txt` file for persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **View All Tasks**: Displays all tasks with their completion status (`[ ]` for incomplete and `[X]` for completed).
- **Edit an Existing Task**: Allows the user to edit the description of an existing task.
- **Delete a Task**: Enables the user to delete a specific task.
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Marks a specific task as completed.
- **Mark Task as Uncompleted**: Marks a specific task as uncompleted.
- **File Persistence**: All tasks are saved to and loaded from `tasks.txt`.
