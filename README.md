Internship projects for CodSoft

This repository contains the projects developed as part of my internship at **CodSoft**. Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming, such as task management, password generation, games, and more.

## Projects

### Project 1: Rock Paper Scissors
A Python game of **Rock Paper Scissors** where users can play against the computer. The game randomly selects an option and determines the winner.

- **File**: `Project1_RockPaperScissors/rock_paper_scissors.py`

### Project 2: To-Do List
A simple **To-Do List** application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or pending. Tasks are saved in a file (`tasks.txt`) to persist between sessions.

- **File**: `Project2_ToDoList/to_do.py`

### Project 3: Calculator
A command-line **Calculator** application that supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **File**: `Project3_Calculator/calculator.py`

### Project 4: Password Generator
A **Password Generator** using the Diceware method to generate secure passphrases. Users can specify the number of words to be included in the passphrase.

- **File**: `Project4_PasswordGenerator/password.py`

### Project 5: Contact Book
A **Contact Book** application where users can add, view, update, and delete contact information. The contact details are saved in a file (`contacts.txt`).

- **File**: `Project5_ContactBook/contact.py`

## How to Run the Projects

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x

### Steps to Run Each Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codsoft.git
    cd codsoft
    ```

2. **Run each project**:
    - For **Project 1** (Rock Paper Scissors):
        ```bash
        python Project1_RockPaperScissors/rock_paper_scissors.py
        ```
    - For **Project 2** (To-Do List):
        ```bash
        python Project2_ToDoList/todo_list.py
        ```
    - For **Project 3** (Calculator):
        ```bash
        python Project3_Calculator/calculator.py
        ```
    - For **Project 4** (Password Generator):
        ```bash
        python Project4_PasswordGenerator/password_generator.py
        ```
    - For **Project 5** (Contact Book):
        ```bash
        python Project5_ContactBook/contact_book.py
        ```

3. **Interact with the applications**:
    - Each project provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) to interact with.

## File Storage

- **Project 2 (To-Do List)**: Tasks are saved in `tasks.txt` to persist between sessions.
- **Project 5 (Contact Book)**: Contacts are saved in `contacts.txt` for persistent storage.
